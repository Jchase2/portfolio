# JChase2's Portfolio 

## What is this? 

This is a portfolio site I'm building to host / link to my various projects. 

# Documentation

I'm documenting my progress here, becuase why not? 

## Webpack Setup

I've decided to use webpack as my module bundler / base for the site. I've used it several times before, 
but usually in the context of react. It'll be interesting setting it up from scratch for a non-react project.

So far, I'm using babel, style-loader and css-loader, file-manager, webpack-dev-server, clean-webpack-plugin, 
html-webpack-plugin, and webpack-cli.

## Libraries 

Bootstrap.
